I had my half time seminar of my PhD studies. I am working on Fair Decision Making process using Synthetic data and Fair representation. Beside this, I am also working on Time-Series Generative Models.

Look in to my publications list in Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vMGTB1UAAAAJ&hl=en
